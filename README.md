# Bell App Lab

Bell App Lab has been working in the mobile space for 10+ years, with strong focus on native applications for both the Apple platforms and Android.ðŸ“±

Throughout the years, some patterns in development were formed and it became clear that some functionalities were being duplicated from project to project. Some of the problems have other solutions available, but they are either too complex to learn or too bloated in terms of child-dependencies. 

Thus, this collection of open-source projects is driven by these simple principles: adding crucial functionality to apps with as little overhead as possible. 

Most of the projects here have already been used in production apps and have saved a lot of development time by solving problems neatly. 

By sponsoring these projects, you'll encourage their maintenance and upkeep, as well as the investigation and implementation of new features, not to mention new projects coming down the pipeline.
